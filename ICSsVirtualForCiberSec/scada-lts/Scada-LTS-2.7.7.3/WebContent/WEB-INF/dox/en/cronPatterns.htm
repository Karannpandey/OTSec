<p>Cron patterns originated from the unix-based "cron" (from "chronological") utility. Although the patterns may at first appear arcane, they are in fact simple, powerful, and elegant ways of defining a large set of time-based events.</p>

<p>Cron patterns in Mango are implemented by Quartz, a Java-based scheduling library. More information on the definition of cron patterns can be found here:</p>

<p>Example configuration: <b>1 */15 * * * ?</b> = At second :01, every 15 minutes starting at minute :00, of every hour </p>
